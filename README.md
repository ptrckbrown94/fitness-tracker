# fitness-tracker
## Description 
For this assignment, you'll create a workout tracker. I was  provided with the front end code in the `Develop` folder. In this assignment I was required  to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user has an internet connection they should be able to use the application.  

## Usage
This was a homework assignement, but the usage would be to took track of you physical activity. 

## Credit
I  create this project from the outline given to me by my Triology Education Services instructor. I  also took code from my old homework and in class activities. I had help from my tutor Isabel Arcones.

## Contributing 
I was the only person contributing to this project, but  had help from my professor, TA, tutor and classmates. 

## Challenges
I took some of the database routes from an in class activity, but I didn't realize I hadn't changed it to the database in the seeders folder. I also had trouble with the route for adding a "new workout". The reason I was having such trouble was because I had a "w" and not a "W" in one of my routes.
